# Introduction

Drug repurposing is one of the most important strategies for saving time and money in the discovery of new therapies for neglected infectious diseases. Triclabendazole (TCBZ) is an approved drug to treat human fasciolosis and it has already shown antiproliferative activity against T. cruzi, T. brucei, and L. infantum. More investigations about this drug in other parasites of the genus leishmania can elucidate if the TCBZ is a good candidate for the treatment of different kinds of leishmaniasis and test whether it has a synergic effect to be implemented as an adjuvant to reduce the dose of toxic compounds already used to treat leishmaniasis.\
Cytotoxicity assays are one additional step performed in drug development and also in drug repurposing. It consists of a viability assay in a host cell model such as THP-1 monocytes differentiated in macrophages. This experiment provides a way to compare the selectivity of a compound to act on the parasite instead of the host cell. The data used in this evaluation corresponds to the results of viability assays to check the toxicity of TCBZ in THP-1 cells in the context of TCBZ repurposing evaluation for cutaneous leishmaniasis.

### Methods

Viability assays using MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide) are the most common and simple form of in vitro test compounds. MTT is a salt that is reduced form produces a colorimetric reaction that can be evaluated by absorbance. The reduction is proportional to viable cell mitochondria reduction activity. So, as a result of exposure to different compound concentrations, it is possible to fit a drug response curve and evaluate metrics of drug efficacy such as IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration). [write about seletivety index]

### Goal

The main goal in this analysis is to set a log logistic model fit to THP-1 cells exposed to triclabendazol, calculate the IC50 and use this result to identify the seletivety index of this drug for the parasites. in future analysis.

## Data analysis

The raw data were composed of three independent experiment reads with 11 concentrations of triclabendazole and one control per plate. To each condition, in each olate 8 technical replicates were otained. After conversion the raw data into only one dataframe in tyde data (Script 01), the firts step for exploratory data analysis were identify variables classes that composes the dataframe and convert them to a more adequate manner to initiate the analysis. Absorbance values were reescaled in a interval between 0 and 1 to facilitate data visualization. After that, all set of central tendencies mesures and the standard deviatrion were visualized for each concentration of the drug. Two outliers were identified. Those removed mesures corresponds to technical replicates and were highly discrepants, adressing a variance not necessaily given by the treatment. Because of this they were removed. Boxplots were generated to sumarizes all relevant informations.

"Boxplot of absorbance values for all concentrations tested"

As observed, we have more variability at the cells exposed to smaller levels of the drug. One super common factor that impacts variability is the position of the treatments inside the plate, besause of border effects. Border effects consists maily in external noise induced by media evaporation and temperature variances. Trying to identify if there were more variabiliry on the wells positioned at the border, I choose to set up a score to the wells accordingly with their position in the plate ( figure ). This is given by the function PositionScore. The following boxplot shows the result of the variance in absorbance values per dose accordingly with wells position inside the plate. Unfortunetly,this data were not collected with this goal and bacause of its inbalance its not possible to test or confirm if the variability in these case is due to border effect. Howerver, for those concentrations with observations for all positions, no tendency of higher variabilities on the border were observed.
