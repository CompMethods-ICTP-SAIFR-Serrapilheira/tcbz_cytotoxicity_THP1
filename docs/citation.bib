	abstract = {Chagas disease is a parasitic infection caused by the protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi that affects about 6 million people in Latin America. Despite its sanitary importance, there are currently only two drugs available for treatment: benznidazole and nifurtimox, both exhibiting serious adverse effects and limited efficacy in the chronic stage of the disease. Polyamines are ubiquitous to all living organisms where they participate in multiple basic functions such as biosynthesis of nucleic acids and proteins, proliferation and cell differentiation. T. cruzi is auxotroph for polyamines, which are taken up from the extracellular medium by efficient transporters and, to a large extent, incorporated into trypanothione (bis-glutathionylspermidine), the major redox cosubstrate of trypanosomatids. From a 268-compound database containing polyamine analogs with and without inhibitory effect on T. cruzi we have inferred classificatory models that were later applied in a virtual screening campaign to identify anti-trypanosomal compounds among drugs already used for other therapeutic indications (i.e. computer-guided drug repositioning) compiled in the DrugBank and Sweetlead databases. Five of the candidates identified with this strategy were evaluated in cellular models from different pathogenic trypanosomatids (T. cruzi wt, T. cruzi PAT12, T. brucei and Leishmania infantum), and in vitro models of aminoacid/polyamine transport assays and trypanothione synthetase inhibition assay. Triclabendazole, sertaconazole and paroxetine displayed inhibitory effects on the proliferation of T. cruzi (epimastigotes) and the uptake of putrescine by the parasite. They also interfered with the uptake of others aminoacids and the proliferation of infective T. brucei and L. infantum (promastigotes). Trypanothione synthetase was ruled out as molecular target for the anti-parasitic activity of these compounds.},

The assays described are based on measurement of a marker activity associated with viable cell number. These assays are used for measuring the results of cell proliferation, testing for cytotoxic effects of compounds, and for multiplexing as an internal control to determine viable cell number during other cell-based assays.},

	abstract = {Introduction
The armamentarium of antileishmanials is small. It is further being threatened by development of resistance and decreasing sensitivity to the available drugs. Development of newer drugs are sorely needed.

Areas covered
Literature search on investigational drugs for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) was done on PubMed. Those candidates with at least in vitro and in vivo activity against leishmania species causing VL were reviewed. Among the investigational drugs the nitroimidazole compound fexinidazole is the one of the few drugs which has reached phase II trials. Although the (S)-PA-824 is in phase II trials for the treatment of tuberculosis its R enantiomer has shown good antileishmanial activity. Development of sitamaquin, which has completed phase II studies has been stopped for VL due to its low efficacy. Many novel delivery system and oral formulations of Amphotericin B which are cheap and less toxic are in investigational stages, and will go a long way in improving the treatment of VL.

Expert opinion
Very few new drugs have reached the clinical stage in the treatment of this neglected tropical disease. Thus, there is an urgent need for support from public private partnerships to ensure that drug candidates are promptly taken forward into development.},

The extension package drc for the statistical environment R provides a flexible and versatile infrastructure for dose-response analyses in general. The present version of the package, reflecting extensions and modifications over the last decade, provides a user-friendly interface to specify the model assumptions about the dose-response relationship and comes with a number of extractors for summarizing fitted models and carrying out inference on derived parameters. The aim of the present paper is to provide an overview of state-of-the-art dose-response analysis, both in terms of general concepts that have evolved and matured over the years and by means of concrete examples.},

	abstract = {Many drug concentration-effect relationships are described by nonlinear sigmoid models. The 4-parameter Hill model, which belongs to this class, is commonly used. An experimental design is essential to accurately estimate the parameters of the model. In this report we investigate properties of D-optimal designs. D-optimal designs minimize the volume of the confidence region for the parameter estimates or, equivalently, minimize the determinant of the variance-covariance matrix of the estimated parameters. It is assumed that the variance of the random error is proportional to some power of the response. To generate D-optimal designs one needs to assume the values of the parameters. Even when these preliminary guesses about the parameter values are appreciably different from the true values of the parameters, the D-optimal designs produce satisfactory results. This property of D-optimal designs is called robustness. It can be quantified by using D-efficiency. A five-point design consisting of four D-optimal points and an extra fifth point is introduced with the goals to increase robustness and to better characterize the middle part of the Hill curve. Four-point D-optimal designs are then compared to five-point designs and to log-spread designs, both theoretically and practically with laboratory experiments., D-optimal designs proved themselves to be practical and useful when the true underlying model is known, when good prior knowledge of parameters is available, and when experimental units are dear. The goal of this report is to give the practitioner a better understanding for D-optimal designs as a useful tool for the routine planning of laboratory experiments.},
